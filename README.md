## Development

### Extension Structure

- `src/content/` - Content script that runs on X/Twitter pages
- `src/background/` - Background script for handling downloads
- `src/popup/` - Extension popup UI
- `native_host/` - Python-based native messaging host

### Building

```bash
# Development build with watch mode
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
```

### Native Host Development

The native host uses yt-dlp to handle video downloads. The communication flow is:
1. Extension detects video and sends URL to native host
2. Native host downloads video using yt-dlp
3. Native host sends download status back to extension

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Native host not connecting**
   - Make sure Python and yt-dlp are installed
   - Reinstall the native host: `python native_host/install_host.py`
   - Check the logs in `native_host/native_host.log`

2. **Download button not appearing**
   - Refresh the page
   - Make sure you're on X.com or Twitter.com
   - Check if the video is in a supported format

3. **Downloads failing**
   - Check if yt-dlp is up to date: `pip install -U yt-dlp`
   - Verify you have write permissions in the downloads directory
   - Check Chrome's console for error messages
